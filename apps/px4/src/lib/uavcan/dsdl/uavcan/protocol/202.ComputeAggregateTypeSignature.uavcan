#
# This service allows to detect type compatibility between two nodes in one request.
# Number of items in the ID mask depends on the data type kind:
#  - 512 for services
#  - 2048 for messages
#  - All other lengths are invalid
# If the server encounters invalid length, missing bits will be assumed zero, excessive bits will be ignored.
